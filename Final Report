The Automated Deadlock Detection Tool, developed by Anushka, Geetanjali Jena, Grainy under Amandeep Kaur's supervision, is designed to identify and resolve deadlocks in systems. It employs a graph-based approach, specifically cycle detection within a Resource Allocation Graph constructed from user-provided input. The tool offers both manual and automatic options for resolving detected deadlocks. Additionally, it includes visualization features to display resource dependencies and highlight deadlock cycles, aiding in system debugging. Built using Python, with the NetworkX library for graph processing and Matplotlib for visualization, this student project aims to enhance system efficiency and reliability.
